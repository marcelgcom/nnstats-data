Two relevant traits, primarily a voyager and little else. It's fine to beam aboard some crew like that if situations are favorable; campaign, maybe some lucky packs, but you'll want a bit more meat on the bones of most of your investments at the Legendary level.\nWith the presumptive end of Discovery megas, those two aforementioned traits (Innovator, Explorer) are going to need to do a lot of heavy lifting for events, because...uh...there won't be variants. With little else of note on the periphery of this card, it's best to only approach Straal if you can get him fused in his salad years while his voyaging fungi are still producing.","bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=0\u0026range=A503","traits":["Starfleet","Federation","Exomycologist","Explorer","Human","Innovator"],"collections":["The Daystrom Award"],"date":"2021-09-30T00:00:00Z","obtained":"Event","primary":{"skill":"sci","base":1548,"min":360,"max":541},"secondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1269,"min":192,"max":302},"tertiary":{"skill":"eng","base":590,"min":66,"max":189},"rawPrimary":{"skill":"sci","base":1280,"min":300,"max":451},"rawSecondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1032,"min":158,"max":248},"rawTertiary":{"skill":"eng","base":472,"min":55,"max":158},"tier":3,"voyage":7.82,"voyageR":54,"gauntlet":4.62,"gauntletR":368,"event":6.28,"eventR":395,"shuttle":6.45,"shuttleR":111,"coll":5.73,"collR":331},{"symbol":"sutra_crew","name":"Sutra","rarity":4,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_sutra_sm.png","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_sutra_full.png","leftImg":false,"note":"In an alternate universe Sutra teams up with Pussy Galore to run surveillance for the suave British MI6 agent Felix Leiter as he cuts down Oddjob on his way to foiling Auric Goldfinger's plot and the bumbling American agent James Bond causes countless international incidents.

While event work will be trait-dependent and inconsistent, her traits have paid off in spurts thus far and that tiny, hidden Picard trait may bear fruit down the line, even if it doesn't enjoy the terrorizing run that Discovery did.
