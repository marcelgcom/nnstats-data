That improvement only consists of a minor increase in CMD and ENG average rolls as neither card gets above 25% crit. This confines him to CMD/ENG utility with plenty of competition from higher crit crew.\nIt is also unfortunate that the first ENG on a Picard comes as a secondary skill on a gauntlet card. However, that should still earn him a seat on one of the rarer shuttles in typical Picard events.\nThe only worthy mention for the voyager EV Suit Picard is his Astrophysicist seat which no one else in this skill set can fill with a trait match. But it is only mildly useful until you retrieve Captain Braxton or purchase the recently added Honor Hall crew.","traits":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Astrophysicist","Inspiring","Tactician"],"collections":["To Boldly Go","A Little Stroll"],"primary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1286,"min":289,"max":922},"secondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1080,"min":255,"max":547},"tertiary":{"skill":"cmd","base":535,"min":97,"max":248},"tier":5,"voyage":14.07,"voyageR":234,"gauntlet":5.56,"gauntletR":15,"event":7.48,"eventR":202,"shuttle":4.56,"shuttleR":449},{"symbol":"burnham_captain_crew","name":"Captain Burnham","rarity":5,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_captain_burnham_sm.png","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_captain_burnham_full.png","leftImg":false,"note":"To borrow an expression, why does this crew need to be? We'll get to her standalone merits in a moment, but as a Burnham variant, she brings nothing to the table that can't be obtained in better amounts elsewhere.\nDebuting as the third best CMD base for Burnham's dependable event history, her strong overall ranking is somewhat muted by being tethered to a character which covers that skill quite well on shuttles already. And the CMD/DIP/SUCK skill set makes Cap'n Burnham victim number 200-something, neutering an already mediocre power level for a new crew release.\nThat being said, there is readily apparent value in a crew who gets Burnham's time in the spotlight with a strong base and worthwhile collection spot. She will earn shuttle work (and some short-lived voyage fill-ins), just be aware that those are more or less secondary benefits for a character that you like and that there are more useful options out there if you're looking purely at gameplay potential.","bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=0\u0026range=A479","traits":["Federation","Starfleet","Human","Resourceful","Inspiring","Xenoanthropology","Explorer"],"collections":["To Boldly Go","Original Thinking"],"primary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1600,"min":215,"max":495},"secondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":993,"min":193,"max":376},"tertiary":{"skill":"cmd","base":702,"min":115,"max":251},"tier":5,"voyage":14.27,"voyageR":193,"gauntlet":1.97,"gauntletR":389,"event":7.07,"eventR":276,"shuttle":7.54,"shuttleR":58}]
