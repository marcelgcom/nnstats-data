Two relevant traits, primarily a voyager and little else. It's fine to beam aboard some crew like that if situations are favorable; campaign, maybe some lucky packs, but you'll want a bit more meat on the bones of most of your investments at the Legendary level.\nWith the presumptive end of Discovery megas, those two aforementioned traits (Innovator, Explorer) are going to need to do a lot of heavy lifting for events, because...uh...there won't be variants. With little else of note on the periphery of this card, it's best to only approach Straal if you can get him fused in his salad years while his voyaging fungi are still producing.","bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=0\u0026range=A503","traits":["Starfleet","Federation","Exomycologist","Explorer","Human","Innovator"],"collections":["The Daystrom Award"],"primary":{"skill":"sci","base":1548,"min":357,"max":536},"secondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1269,"min":192,"max":302},"tertiary":{"skill":"eng","base":590,"min":66,"max":189},"tier":4,"voyage":7.8,"voyageR":54,"gauntlet":4.61,"gauntletR":370,"event":6.28,"eventR":395,"shuttle":6.45,"shuttleR":111,"coll":5.06,"collR":420,"crNow":0,"crLater":0},{"symbol":"sutra_crew","name":"Sutra","rarity":4,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_sutra_sm.png","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_sutra_full.png","leftImg":false,"bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=1996288629\u0026range=A410","traits":["Telepath","Android","Brutal","Desperate","Survivalist"],"collections":["Survival Training","Fully Functional"],"primary":{"skill":"sec","base":1094,"min":70,"max":458},"secondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":825,"min":65,"max":175},"tertiary":{"skill":"sci","base":365,"min":23,"max":92},"tier":5,"voyage":6.43,"voyageR":174,"gauntlet":2.69,"gauntletR":873,"event":7.33,"eventR":207,"shuttle":9.19,"shuttleR":27,"coll":6.52,"collR":146,"crNow":0,"crLater":0},{"symbol":"mitchell_crew","name":"Lt.

Out of place item and proficiency ranges \"are as intended\", but stand at odds with a crew truly usable in the gauntlet. If minimum rolls didn't exist, Antaak and 1-skill Chapel would be marauding around regularly. In the real world, where gauntlet's coin flip nature is already frustrating enough, you would be doing yourself no favors by bringing 'the bad Gary' along.\nA true to life trait set unfortunately doesn't do much to buoy Mitchell's rolls; he only catches a single 45%+ gauntlet, during which will be the only time any of his proficiency pairs sneak into the top twenty. A letdown elsewhere as well, his traits trigger no collections (yet), have him behind multiple anti-matter options in every possible seat on voyages, and only Pilot has provided more than one-off event work.","bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=0\u0026range=A495","traits":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Brutal","Pilot","Telekinetic","Telepath"],"primary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1488,"min":14,"max":858},"secondary":{"skill":"sec","base":1179,"min":22,"max":596},"tertiary":{"skill":"dip","base":589,"min":83,"max":178},"tier":7,"voyage":6.44,"voyageR":210,"gauntlet":5.06,"gauntletR":270,"event":6.18,"eventR":413,"shuttle":4.86,"shuttleR":245,"coll":1.08,"collR":497,"crNow":0,"crLater":0}]
