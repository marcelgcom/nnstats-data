Out of place item and proficiency ranges \"are as intended\", but stand at odds with a crew truly usable in the gauntlet. If minimum rolls didn't exist, Antaak and 1-skill Chapel would be marauding around regularly. In the real world, where gauntlet's coin flip nature is already frustrating enough, you would be doing yourself no favors by bringing 'the bad Gary' along.\nA true to life trait set unfortunately doesn't do much to buoy Mitchell's rolls; he only catches a single 45%+ gauntlet, during which will be the only time any of his proficiency pairs sneak into the top twenty. A letdown elsewhere as well, his traits trigger no collections (yet), have him behind multiple anti-matter options in every possible seat on voyages, and only Pilot has provided more than one-off event work.","bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=0\u0026range=A495","traits":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Brutal","Pilot","Telekinetic","Telepath"],"primary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1488,"min":14,"max":858},"secondary":{"skill":"sec","base":1169,"min":22,"max":591},"tertiary":{"skill":"dip","base":589,"min":83,"max":178},"tier":7,"voyage":8.43,"voyageR":209,"gauntlet":6.52,"gauntletR":271,"event":6.15,"eventR":412,"shuttle":4.35,"shuttleR":240,"coll":1,"collR":436},{"symbol":"picard_evsuit_crew","name":"EV Suit Picard","rarity":5,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_picard_evsuit_sm.png","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_picard_evsuit_full.png","leftImg":false,"note":"Reminiscent of a Mirror Spock or Survivalist Kirk, this Picard is a sum-of-his-parts crew who checks value boxes in an effort to overcome poor surface-level metrics. Viable in the realms of gauntlet, events, collections, and arena to varying degrees, you'll want to check how he stacks up against your current options rather than treating him like a first round draft pick whose power will force his way into service for you.\nThe easy comparison in gauntlet is a beefy Braxton. Better pri/sec pair and single CMD roll than the transcendent voyager means that Picard will outperform him there in almost every instance, despite not having any 45% or better crit sets. The resultant low bases combined with sufficient event chances might get him lost in the crowd of an endgame roster on occasion, but makes him more valuable than most one-off characters.","bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=0\u0026range=A489","traits":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Astrophysicist","Inspiring","Tactician"],"collections":["A Little Stroll","To Boldly Go"],"primary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1286,"min":289,"max":922},"secondary":{"skill":"eng","base":1080,"min":255,"max":547},"tertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":535,"min":97,"max":248},"tier":3,"voyage":8.35,"voyageR":234,"gauntlet":8.59,"gauntletR":15,"event":7.57,"eventR":204,"shuttle":3.38,"shuttleR":449,"coll":7.11,"collR":138},{"symbol":"data_sacrifice_crew","name":"Nemesis Sacrifice Data","rarity":4,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_data_sacrifice_sm.png","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_data_sacrifice_full.png","leftImg":true,"note":"Android Goes Boom, a gripping independent film, will enjoy a limited run in arena and skirmish theaters across the country.

Wonderfully thematic for this sacrifice variant, the one-time use and huge evasion penalty means you either end the battle with him or die trying.\nIt takes a lot to push a crew's triple collections to the second paragraph - his three appliable traits would make most super rares an automatic behold choice with so much overall roster power coming from collection boosts these days.

We'll get to her standalone merits in a moment, but as a Burnham variant, she brings nothing to the table that can't be obtained in better amounts elsewhere.\nDebuting as the third best CMD base for Burnham's dependable event history, her strong overall ranking is somewhat muted by being tethered to a character which covers that skill quite well on shuttles already. And the CMD/DIP/SUCK skill set makes Cap'n Burnham victim number 200-something, neutering an already mediocre power level for a new crew release.\nThat being said, there is readily apparent value in a crew who gets Burnham's time in the spotlight with a strong base and worthwhile collection spot. She will earn shuttle work (and some short-lived voyage fill-ins), just be aware that those are more or less secondary benefits for a character that you like and that there are more useful options out there if you're looking purely at gameplay potential.","bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=0\u0026range=A479","traits":["Federation","Starfleet","Human","Resourceful","Inspiring","Xenoanthropology","Explorer"],"collections":["To Boldly Go","Original Thinking"],"primary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1600,"min":215,"max":495},"secondary":{"skill":"dip","base":993,"min":193,"max":376},"tertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":702,"min":115,"max":251},"tier":5,"voyage":8.48,"voyageR":193,"gauntlet":6.16,"gauntletR":389,"event":7.26,"eventR":259,"shuttle":7.19,"shuttleR":58,"coll":7.6,"collR":85},{"symbol":"kyheem_steward_crew","name":"Steward Kyheem","rarity":4,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_kyheem_steward_sm.png","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_kyheem_steward_full.png","leftImg":true,"note":"If you've ever wanted Roman Captive Kirk without the outrageous swagger and stint as a 1980's beat cop, then welcome aboard Steward Kyheem.
