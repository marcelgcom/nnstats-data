He may catch a mega or two down the line as tie-ins to selling collection-themed packs, but bet on the Leftenant for his tangible, day one voyage and collection value and accept anything else as bonus.","traits":["Human","Inspiring","Federation","Starfleet","Resourceful","Communicator"],"collections":["Original Thinking","To Boldly Go"],"date":"2021-11-30T00:41:08.708Z","obtained":"N/A","primary":{"skill":"dip","base":1590,"min":310,"max":612},"secondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1180,"min":225,"max":478},"tertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":770,"min":130,"max":255},"rawPrimary":{"skill":"dip","base":1272,"min":259,"max":510},"rawSecondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":944,"min":182,"max":386},"rawTertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":621,"min":104,"max":204},"tier":2,"voyage":9.66,"voyageR":2,"gauntlet":5.67,"gauntletR":171,"event":6.6,"eventR":372,"shuttle":6.14,"shuttleR":133,"coll":6.27,"collR":195,"arena":2.9,"arenaR":415},{"symbol":"ancient_humanoid_crew","name":"Ancient Humanoid","rarity":5,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_ancient_humanoid_sm.webp","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_ancient_humanoid_full.webp","leftImg":false,"note":"If mom tells you we have Ancient Humanoid at home and tries to stick you with Changeling Founder, don't listen!

Her stats are allocated for such a purpose, also besting Pupcard's secondary and tertiary, elevating Humanoid into 'best SCI shuttler' territory.\r\n\r\nNot a one hit wonder, we have some impressive voyage metrics coming from this crew as well.

Somewhat mis-labeled as a 'gauntlet crew', Kira is more of an all-rounder, at least at this stage of her lifespan. \r\n\r\nProphet has the requisite voyage power for a two-to-three year usability profile starting at release on many rosters, but two black marks against her are an awful skill set and the unfortunate timing of being released in the midst of so many other CMD/DIP/SUCK options, most of them superior. There's a chance that when WRG fixes her erroneous Federation and Starfleet traits, they upgrade them with the Duelist and Cultural Figure tags she deserves - hopefully that occurs while she's still a voyage option.\r\n\r\nA surprisingly relevant event option for a card with 'gauntlet crew' bases, Kira is the picture of consistency when it comes to event bonuses and has only dipped below four features in a calendar year once. If the aforementioned trait changes are made, that would only enhance her weekend shuttle work which includes perhaps the juiciest skill order possible for shuttle seating.\r\n\r\nIn order to get paid our three cents per word, we've kept gauntlet for last. Kira does boast worthwhile overall power and a good single roll - good enough to be an option in most of her 25% gauntlets. Unfortunately, her crit is capped at that amount and her skill set is ultra competitive. If you pick her up while you're still Balok-less or to avoid Kahless' price tag, she'll put in more work for you than she would on a \"complete\" roster, but she's at least an occasional option for everyone.","traits":["Bajoran","Federation","Starfleet","Spiritual","Maverick"],"date":"2021-11-25T00:00:00Z","obtained":"Event","primary":{"skill":"sec","base":1275,"min":372,"max":876},"secondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1221,"min":198,"max":580},"tertiary":{"skill":"dip","base":576,"min":175,"max":364},"rawPrimary":{"skill":"sec","base":1029,"min":298,"max":701},"rawSecondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":977,"min":160,"max":468},"rawTertiary":{"skill":"dip","base":461,"min":146,"max":304},"tier":3,"voyage":7.81,"voyageR":65,"gauntlet":7.29,"gauntletR":34,"event":8.23,"eventR":76,"shuttle":4.39,"shuttleR":339,"coll":1.88,"collR":476,"arena":3.3,"arenaR":300},{"symbol":"obrien_racquetball_crew","name":"Racquetball O'Brien","rarity":5,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_obrien_racquetball_sm.webp","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_obrien_racquetball_full.webp","leftImg":false,"note":"This is the ideal male body.
