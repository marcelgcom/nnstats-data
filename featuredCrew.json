But speaking of drop shots, you must have had a dozen ENG voyages by now and Miles hasn't missed one yet. Nobody can be that lucky, it's impossible.\n\nPirouetting neutrinos aren't to blame this time, Miley's just a wrecking ball on voyages thanks to his hefty overall score and tree trunk-like ankles. 'Rambo from Wish' shares a skill set with big brother Scapeüêê O'Brien, but a different enough order to be a great compliment rather than competition.\n\nRelatively weak accompanying traits don't do him a ton of favors for collections or event work, but smart money still has him picking up one or two collections/megas before WRG's love affair with traits comes to an end. With O'Brien variant events in the mix as well, he's a top-heavy offering, but one with enough utility to escape the one trick pony designation - at least, if you believe his arena ability quote.","traits":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Athlete","Desperate","Duelist"],"date":"2021-11-18T00:00:00Z","obtained":"Event","primary":{"skill":"eng","base":1582,"min":303,"max":540},"secondary":{"skill":"dip","base":1265,"min":223,"max":427},"tertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":608,"min":120,"max":323},"rawPrimary":{"skill":"eng","base":1266,"min":253,"max":450},"rawSecondary":{"skill":"dip","base":1012,"min":186,"max":356},"rawTertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":491,"min":96,"max":259},"tier":2,"voyage":8.7,"voyageR":16,"gauntlet":6.18,"gauntletR":102,"event":7.29,"eventR":270,"shuttle":5.47,"shuttleR":184,"coll":1.64,"collR":505},{"symbol":"li_nalas_crew","name":"Li Nalas","rarity":5,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_li_nalas_sm.webp","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_li_nalas_full.webp","leftImg":false,"note":"As someone once said, this is what you're hoping for if they add your favorite crew to the game. The odds of Li Nalas being, say, the number one voyager were about as likely as catching a Cardassian Gul unarmed and in his underwear. But Li is looking at a few years of voyage use (even as CMD/DIP/SUCK) for the average roster with usable shuttle metrics and a non-HFS trait set, which is always ripe for collections and events.
