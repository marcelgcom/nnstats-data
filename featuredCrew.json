Having hit on a few collections already, the rest of his list excludes the most bloated groups and all have a chance to bump up his value in that area going forward or put his poor bases in a shuttle seat for two to four days at a time.","traits":["Ferengi","Smuggler","Explorer","Criminal","Crafty"],"collections":["Criminal Minds","Rules Of Acquisition"],"date":"2021-11-04T00:00:00Z","obtained":"Event","primary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1493,"min":261,"max":569},"secondary":{"skill":"dip","base":1124,"min":179,"max":343},"tertiary":{"skill":"eng","base":563,"min":127,"max":252},"rawPrimary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1214,"min":214,"max":467},"rawSecondary":{"skill":"dip","base":922,"min":151,"max":289},"rawTertiary":{"skill":"eng","base":451,"min":106,"max":210},"tier":8,"voyage":5.76,"voyageR":287,"gauntlet":5.06,"gauntletR":274,"event":6.38,"eventR":389,"shuttle":4.6,"shuttleR":312,"coll":6.25,"collR":254},{"symbol":"kyle_transporter_chief_crew","name":"Transporter Chief Kyle","rarity":4,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_kyle_transporter_chief_sm.webp","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_kyle_transporter_chief_full.webp","leftImg":false,"note":"I'm not sure what Kyle enthusiasts were expecting from his debut crew, but this might even be better than that.
