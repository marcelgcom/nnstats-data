Nobody can be that lucky, it's impossible.\n\nPirouetting neutrinos aren't to blame this time, Miley's just a wrecking ball on voyages thanks to his hefty overall score and tree trunk-like ankles. 'Rambo from Wish' shares a skill set with big brother Scapeüêê O'Brien, but a different enough order to be a great compliment rather than competition.\n\nRelatively weak accompanying traits don't do him a ton of favors for collections or event work, but smart money still has him picking up one or two collections/megas before WRG's love affair with traits comes to an end. With O'Brien variant events in the mix as well, he's a top-heavy offering, but one with enough utility to escape the one trick pony designation - at least, if you believe his arena ability quote.","traits":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Athlete","Desperate","Duelist"],"date":"2021-11-18T00:00:00Z","obtained":"Event","primary":{"skill":"eng","base":1582,"min":303,"max":540},"secondary":{"skill":"dip","base":1265,"min":223,"max":427},"tertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":608,"min":120,"max":323},"rawPrimary":{"skill":"eng","base":1266,"min":253,"max":450},"rawSecondary":{"skill":"dip","base":1012,"min":186,"max":356},"rawTertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":491,"min":96,"max":259},"tier":2,"voyage":8.82,"voyageR":14,"gauntlet":6.18,"gauntletR":101,"event":7.28,"eventR":264,"shuttle":5.48,"shuttleR":186,"coll":1.62,"collR":495},{"symbol":"li_nalas_crew","name":"Li Nalas","rarity":5,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_li_nalas_sm.webp","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_li_nalas_full.webp","leftImg":true,"note":"As someone once said, this is what you're hoping for if they add your favorite crew to the game.
