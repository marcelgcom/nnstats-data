Yes, Lara's the worst voyager they've ever released and yes, her art looks like a crappy sticker from some dress-up mobile game (wait a minute...*we're* playing a mobile game). But she's also the first non-exclusive power gauntleteer we've had in years.\n\nDebuting with top ten proficiency, her SEC roll tops the list above Gangster Spock, her CMD/SEC pair matches Kahless, and her DIP/SEC pair is somewhere between Balok and Gowron - heavy names all around. It would have been nice for Lara to avoid the CMD/DIP/SEC clown fiesta, but her skill order and power level still gives her a lot of room to maneuver despite not eclipsing 25% crit in any gauntlet.\n\nA few of her four viable traits have hit on collections already to help make stars two through five feel less awful, but if you wanted to leave her at 1/5 for a while and let beholds nibble away at that collection value over time, that's a viable strategy.","traits":["Human","Resourceful","Hunter","Survivalist","Romantic"],"collections":["Original Thinking","Survival Training"],"date":"2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","obtained":"Pack","primary":{"skill":"sec","base":1058,"min":442,"max":882},"secondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":939,"min":312,"max":671},"tertiary":{"skill":"dip","base":494,"min":186,"max":477},"rawPrimary":{"skill":"sec","base":854,"min":354,"max":706},"rawSecondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":764,"min":256,"max":550},"rawTertiary":{"skill":"dip","base":405,"min":157,"max":401},"tier":3,"voyage":5.17,"voyageR":339,"gauntlet":8.52,"gauntletR":11,"event":5.37,"eventR":482,"shuttle":3.26,"shuttleR":493,"coll":6.21,"collR":116},{"symbol":"daimon_solok_crew","name":"DaiMon Solok","rarity":5,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_daimon_solok_sm.webp","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_daimon_solok_full.webp","leftImg":false,"note":"A thoroughly shameful crew premiere that will have him washing up on the shore next to all the other flotsam.

Having hit on a few collections already, the rest of his list excludes the most bloated groups and all have a chance to bump up his value in that area going forward or put his poor bases in a shuttle seat for two to four days at a time.","traits":["Ferengi","Smuggler","Explorer","Criminal","Crafty"],"collections":["Criminal Minds","Rules Of Acquisition"],"date":"2021-11-04T00:00:00Z","obtained":"Event","primary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1493,"min":261,"max":569},"secondary":{"skill":"dip","base":1124,"min":179,"max":343},"tertiary":{"skill":"eng","base":563,"min":127,"max":252},"rawPrimary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1214,"min":214,"max":467},"rawSecondary":{"skill":"dip","base":922,"min":151,"max":289},"rawTertiary":{"skill":"eng","base":451,"min":106,"max":210},"tier":8,"voyage":5.76,"voyageR":287,"gauntlet":5.06,"gauntletR":274,"event":6.38,"eventR":389,"shuttle":4.5,"shuttleR":304,"coll":4.61,"collR":254}]
