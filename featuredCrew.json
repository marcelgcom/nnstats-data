Two relevant traits, primarily a voyager and little else. It's fine to beam aboard some crew like that if situations are favorable; campaign, maybe some lucky packs, but you'll want a bit more meat on the bones of most of your investments at the Legendary level.\nWith the presumptive end of Discovery megas, those two aforementioned traits (Innovator, Explorer) are going to need to do a lot of heavy lifting for events, because...uh...there won't be variants. With little else of note on the periphery of this card, it's best to only approach Straal if you can get him fused in his salad years while his voyaging fungi are still producing.","bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=0\u0026range=A503","traits":["Starfleet","Federation","Exomycologist","Explorer","Human","Innovator"],"collections":["The Daystrom Award"],"primary":{"skill":"sci","base":1548,"min":357,"max":536},"secondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1269,"min":192,"max":302},"tertiary":{"skill":"eng","base":590,"min":66,"max":189},"tier":4,"voyage":9.06,"voyageR":52,"gauntlet":6.22,"gauntletR":367,"event":6.3,"eventR":394,"shuttle":6.17,"shuttleR":103,"coll":5.06,"collR":417},{"symbol":"mitchell_crew","name":"Lt.

Out of place item and proficiency ranges \"are as intended\", but stand at odds with a crew truly usable in the gauntlet. If minimum rolls didn't exist, Antaak and 1-skill Chapel would be marauding around regularly. In the real world, where gauntlet's coin flip nature is already frustrating enough, you would be doing yourself no favors by bringing 'the bad Gary' along.\nA true to life trait set unfortunately doesn't do much to buoy Mitchell's rolls; he only catches a single 45%+ gauntlet, during which will be the only time any of his proficiency pairs sneak into the top twenty. A letdown elsewhere as well, his traits trigger no collections (yet), have him behind multiple anti-matter options in every possible seat on voyages, and only Pilot has provided more than one-off event work.","bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=0\u0026range=A495","traits":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Brutal","Pilot","Telekinetic","Telepath"],"primary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1488,"min":14,"max":858},"secondary":{"skill":"sec","base":1169,"min":22,"max":591},"tertiary":{"skill":"dip","base":589,"min":83,"max":178},"tier":7,"voyage":8.44,"voyageR":210,"gauntlet":6.52,"gauntletR":271,"event":6.16,"eventR":414,"shuttle":4.35,"shuttleR":242,"coll":1.08,"collR":493},{"symbol":"picard_evsuit_crew","name":"EV Suit Picard","rarity":5,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_picard_evsuit_sm.png","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_picard_evsuit_full.png","leftImg":true,"note":"Reminiscent of a Mirror Spock or Survivalist Kirk, this Picard is a sum-of-his-parts crew who checks value boxes in an effort to overcome poor surface-level metrics. Viable in the realms of gauntlet, events, collections, and arena to varying degrees, you'll want to check how he stacks up against your current options rather than treating him like a first round draft pick whose power will force his way into service for you.\nThe easy comparison in gauntlet is a beefy Braxton. Better pri/sec pair and single CMD roll than the transcendent voyager means that Picard will outperform him there in almost every instance, despite not having any 45% or better crit sets. The resultant low bases combined with sufficient event chances might get him lost in the crowd of an endgame roster on occasion, but makes him more valuable than most one-off characters.","bbLink":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYR5jnqtacbQM9MIsXp6ATs84Q3rbRM3SmKmUtBvlJ0/edit#gid=0\u0026range=A489","traits":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Astrophysicist","Inspiring","Tactician"],"collections":["To Boldly Go","A Little Stroll"],"primary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1286,"min":289,"max":922},"secondary":{"skill":"eng","base":1080,"min":255,"max":547},"tertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":535,"min":97,"max":248},"tier":3,"voyage":8.35,"voyageR":235,"gauntlet":8.59,"gauntletR":15,"event":7.58,"eventR":206,"shuttle":3.38,"shuttleR":450,"coll":7.1,"collR":155},{"symbol":"data_sacrifice_crew","name":"Nemesis Sacrifice Data","rarity":4,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_data_sacrifice_sm.png","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_data_sacrifice_full.png","leftImg":false,"note":"Android Goes Boom, a gripping independent film, will enjoy a limited run in arena and skirmish theaters across the country.
