His weak trait set doesn't do him a lot of favors for dice rolling, but the raw proficiency power is certainly something that early or mid game rosters may wish to go out of their way to grab one star of as a bridge to the overpowered exclusive crew.\r\n\r\nWeak bases aren't an issue in this case as his unfavorable lineup of eventable traits haven't shown up much on the weekend anyways and are probably better as ticking clock future collections. His big arena boom, sequestered behind a trigger and slow activation time, is another one star option for newer players.

He may catch a mega or two down the line as tie-ins to selling collection-themed packs, but bet on the Leftenant for his tangible, day one voyage and collection value and accept anything else as bonus.","traits":["Human","Inspiring","Federation","Starfleet","Resourceful","Communicator"],"collections":["Original Thinking","Healthy Discourse","To Boldly Go"],"date":"2021-12-02T00:00:00Z","obtained":"Event","primary":{"skill":"dip","base":1615,"min":315,"max":622},"secondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":1189,"min":227,"max":482},"tertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":770,"min":130,"max":255},"rawPrimary":{"skill":"dip","base":1272,"min":259,"max":510},"rawSecondary":{"skill":"cmd","base":944,"min":182,"max":386},"rawTertiary":{"skill":"sec","base":621,"min":104,"max":204},"tier":2,"voyage":9.61,"voyageR":4,"gauntlet":5.69,"gauntletR":172,"event":6.38,"eventR":400,"shuttle":6.19,"shuttleR":126,"coll":7.15,"collR":85,"arena":2.01,"arenaR":458},{"symbol":"burnham_resistance_crew","name":"Resistance Burnham","rarity":5,"portrait":"crew_portraits_cm_burnham_resistance_sm.webp","fullBody":"crew_full_body_cm_burnham_resistance_full.webp","leftImg":true,"note":"One of two bookend CMD/DIP/SEC giveaway crew in 2021, on the heels of another CDS Burnham variant, on the heels of back to back CDS mega recurring crew, sandwiched between CDS event crew...
